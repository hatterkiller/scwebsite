    <p>As President this year, Siri has many goals that he'd like Student Council to achieve. Passionate about improving the welfare of the student body and the quality of ISB student government, Siri aims to reform the Student Council. This includes rewriting the constitution to make it up to date and to add necessary clauses, and launching a transparency campaign that involves a method of tracking each Student Council member's role and a public website. <br><a href="#" rel="modal:close">Close</a> </p>

    <p>As you saw, my name is Daiki Shinomiya and I am the Sophomore Council Representative. As you also may have noticed, I made this website. I have been living in Thailand since I was 0 (I was born here) and I practically grew up in ISB. Being here so long, I decided to join the Student Council to give back to the school I grew up in. I plan lead the High school through my limited talents of web design, reading, and solving the Rubik's Cube. This year, my main goal was to increase the communication between students, the council and the teachers through a more productive and effective use of the technology that we have available. <br>
       I also love easter eggs. Hah find them all.

<div id="luluP" style="display:none">
    <p>My name is Lulu Schmitt, I am currently 14 years old, and I am from Germany. I have a older sister who is 18 years old, who currently studies chemistry at university. I was born in Singapore but I've been living in Thailand for 11 years and I've been going to ISB since Kindergarten so I consider Thailand my home. My hobbies include cooking, reading, playing the clarinet and debating but my main hobby is playing volleyball, which I have been playing for 3 years. This year I am representing ninth grade as the president and my main goals are to increase class spirit and make sure that our Freshman voices are heard and I hope that we all have a great year!

    <p>Hello all! As Junior Class President, I'd like to think that I'm a bright, easygoing creative individual who wants to ensure that the school can be to the best it can be of the student body. If you have any issues of the sort, don't be afraid to ask me/approach me in the halls, I'd be happy to help! :) <br><a href="#" rel="modal:close">Close</a> </p>
